# Fraud Detection Dashboard Project
# 🚀 Project Title
Fraud Detection and Analysis using SQL and Excel Dashboard

# 📝 Introduction
This project focuses on detecting and analysing fraudulent transactions using a combination of SQL for data management and cleaning and Microsoft Excel for analysis and dashboard visualisation. It integrates key SQL querying and Excel lookup functionalities to identify suspicious patterns and summarise them effectively for business decision-making.

# 💾 Dataset Description
The dataset includes:

Transactions: Raw transaction data with timestamps, merchant, device, amount, and location details

Rule-based suspects: Transactions flagged as suspicious based on predefined business rules

Combined data: Merged datasets for comprehensive fraud analysis

Analytical sheets: Hourly analysis, location analysis, merchant analysis, device analysis, fraud amount analysis

Dashboard: Visual summary highlighting key fraud insights

# 🛠️ Tools and Techniques Used
SQL:

🔹 Data extraction, cleaning, and transformation

🔹 Writing queries to flag fraudulent transactions based on business rules

🔹 Combining multiple tables to create analysis-ready datasets

Excel:

🔹 VLOOKUP and HLOOKUP for retrieving data both vertically and horizontally within datasets

🔹 Pivot tables and charts for creating an interactive and summarised dashboard

# 📊 Key Features of the Dashboard
✅ Fraud transaction summary and total fraud amount analysis

✅ Hourly distribution of fraudulent transactions

✅ Fraud analysis by merchant, device, and location

✅ Interactive visuals to identify trends and high-risk areas efficiently
